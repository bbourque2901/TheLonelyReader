# Reflection

## Instructions

_Please answer at least one question from each section below as a team. Answers here will likely be inspiration for the “lessons learned” section of your project presentation at the end of the unit._

## Design

### How closely did you follow your design document after the review was complete? Did your implementation need to change based on what you learned once you were underway?
* We followed it pretty closely but ended up having to abandon the comment system due to time constraits. We also had to refactor how we were handling books as a list of books instead of using a list of strings then pulling books from that.
* We followed the design document pretty closely. We mentioned in it that we would repurpose most of the classes of MusicPlaylistService to fit a reading service as our MLP. Any features outside of the template we would consider if we had time to implement and test. This kept everyone on the same page and got our MLP up and running quickly. We then had plenty of time to spare for additional features and frontend development.
  
## Project

### How did you handle the ambiguity of defining your own project and user stories? What strategies did you use to decide on concrete work to do to satisfy your requirements?
  * Keeping user stories short and clear, creating tickets and assigning them to group members, expanding on tickets when the scope of them changed.
  * We didn’t take too much risk with this. We knew how the MusicPlaylistService functioned from the U3 project and decided to stick with its features/user stories to have plenty of time to learn the frontend.
### How did you deal with getting stuck on a problem? What strategies did you employ to get yourself unblocked?
  * Reaching out to instructors and consulting youtube tutorials. Walking through code in the local host browser and seeing what printed to the console then looking up those errors.
  * Each group member was very responsive on Slack (even at work) and Zoom. When I was blocked and asked a group member for help, I’d always get a response. Besides that, just researching the issue until I find a solution. It’s starting to seem to me that whatever problem/blockers I encounter as a dev, another dev has had the same problem before and there’s likely a stack overflow thread about it.  The hard part is fully understanding the problem, and using the right search terms.
### Did any of your commitments you made in your team charter help navigate a difficult decision, situation, or collaboration challenge? How?
  * We stayed communcative the whole time and never ran into any kind of situation.
  * I believe it did! I think because we all stuck to our committments and goals mentioned in the charter throughout the project we had a good final product!

## Scrum

### What did you find to be the most valuable part of daily stand-ups? Is there anything you would want to do differently at stand-up to make it more useful to you?
  * It was helpful knowing what other teammates were working on and if they were making progress, I really like using the polly bot as a quick async update on non sync days.
  * It’s nice to bring everyone together at least once a day to hear updates about different parts of the project. Sometimes what was planned as just a quick, 10 minute meeting turns into a very helpful discussion or bug fixes. These helpful moments that stem from stand-ups that wouldn’t have occurred otherwise makes me understand how valuable those meetings really are.
### Did you over or underestimate the work you could complete during your sprints? What have you learned that will help you better estimate work next time?
  * I think we did as much as we could in the time we were given and I feel like I know how much work I could take on in the future. It's better to undershoot and finish what you promised than to overcommit.

## Looking ahead

* If you were to start this unit over again, what would you do differently? How do you see yourself applying that to your work in later units, the capstone, or your internship?
  Spend more time reading javascript tutorials than just blindly trying to replicate front end code. I plan on doing a lot more research for my capstone before starting.
