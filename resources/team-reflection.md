# Reflection

## Instructions

_Please answer at least one question from each section below as a team. Answers here will likely be inspiration for the “lessons learned” section of your project presentation at the end of the unit._

## Design

* How closely did you follow your design document after the review was complete? Did your implementation need to change based on what you learned once you were underway?
We followed it pretty closely but ended up having to abandon the comment system due to time constraits. We also had to refactor how we were handling books as a list of books instead of using a list of strings then pulling books from that.
## Project

* How did you handle the ambiguity of defining your own project and user stories? What strategies did you use to decide on concrete work to do to
  satisfy your requirements?
  Keeping user stories short and clear, creating tickets and assigning them to group members, expanding on tickets when the scope of them changed.
* How did you deal with getting stuck on a problem? What strategies did you employ to get yourself unblocked?
  Reaching out to instructors and consulting youtube tutorials. Walking through code in the local host browser and seeing what printed to the console then looking up those errors.
* Did any of your commitments you made in your team charter help navigate a difficult decision, situation, or collaboration challenge? How?
  We stayed communcative the whole time and never ran into any kind of situation.

## Scrum

* What did you find to be the most valuable part of daily stand-ups? Is there anything you would want to do differently at stand-up to make it more useful to you?
  It was helpful knowing what other teammates were working on and if they were making progress, I really like using the polly bot as a quick async update on non sync days.
* Did you over or underestimate the work you could complete during your sprints? What have you learned that will help you better estimate work next time?
  I think we did as much as we could in the time we were given and I feel like I know how much work I could take on in the future. It's better to undershoot and finish what you promised than to overcommit.

## Looking ahead

* If you were to start this unit over again, what would you do differently? How do you see yourself applying that to your work in later units, the capstone, or your internship?
  Spend more time reading javascript tutorials than just blindly trying to replicate front end code. I plan on doing a lot more research for my capstone before starting.
